# Config

The vast majority of the customization should be done by changing values in `config`, which should be a `config.yml` file located in the main project repo (not this repo). This repo should try to be flexible to a range of configuration options (within reason).

## Conventions

- Relative links instead of root relative links for paths (where possible) i.e. use `../images/logo.png` instead of `/images/logo.png`
- All directory variables have trailing slash like this: `../path/to/dir/`
